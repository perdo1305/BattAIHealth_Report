  abstract  = {Electric vehicle (EV) technology has come up with showing many alternative solutions to the issues mainly caused due to the carbon emissions by the conventional vehicles and hence grabbed a massive attention of the entire world. Furthermore, while electric vehicles (EVs) have their own advantages, they also have a number of drawbacks, such as concerns with heat management, battery management, health degradation, integration of power electronic conversions, charging and discharging issues, etc. The estimation of SOC and RUL is quiet difficult task as these are highly dependent of temperature measurements. Hence, thermal management is the key challenging task that to be considered in EVs. A comprehensive discussion of battery management systems, including their significant attributes has been addressed in this article.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive survey of machine learning, deep learning, and digital twin technology methods for predicting and managing the battery state of health in electric vehicles. Battery state of health estimation is essential for optimizing the battery usage, performance, safety, and cost-effectiveness of electric vehicles. Estimating the state of health of a battery is a complex undertaking due to its dependency on multiple factors. These factors include battery characteristics such as type, chemistry, size, temperature, current, voltage, impedance, cycle number, and driving pattern. There are drawbacks to traditional methods, such as experimental and model-based approaches, in terms of accuracy, complexity, expense, and viability for real-time applications. By employing a variety of algorithms to discover the nonlinear and dynamic link between the battery parameters and the state of health, data-driven techniques like machine learning, deep learning, and data-driven digital twin technologies can get beyond these restrictions. Data-driven methods can also incorporate physics and domain knowledge to improve the explainability and interpretability of the results. This paper reviews the latest advancements and challenges of using data-driven techniques for battery state of health estimation and management in electric vehicles. The paper also discusses the future directions and opportunities for further research and development in this field. The survey scope spans publications from the year 2021 to 2023.},

	abstract = {Battery management system (BMS) requires an accurate prediction the remaining energy level or state of charge (SOC) of the cell or battery pack. However, in electric vehicles, batteries experience a dynamic operational environment whereby the simple algorithms employed in the portable devices to predict SOC, such as coulomb counting, are insufficient for this purpose. To address this problem, a Kalman filtering method is used to estimate the state of the charge of two different commercial lithium-ion batteries, with new physical insight being provided through an analysis of the Kalman filter covariance noise parameters. For example, the effect of geometry of the battery on value of these parameters is discussed. Different models are developed, tested and incorporated in the filter design. Subsequently, two types of Kalman filters including the extended Kalman filter and dual extended Kalman filter are implemented in order to predict the state of charge of the batteries. It is shown that the Kalman filtering can predict state of the charge of the battery with maximum 4\% error.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider the problem of state of charge estimation for rechargeable batteries. Coulomb counting is one of the traditional approaches to state of charge estimation and it is considered reliable as long as the battery capacity and initial state of charge are known. However, the Coulomb counting method is susceptible to errors from several sources and the extent of these errors are not studied in the literature. In this paper, we formally derive and quantify the state of charge estimation error during Coulomb counting due to the following four types of error sources: (i) current measurement error; (ii) current integration approximation error; (iii) battery capacity uncertainty; and (iv) the timing oscillator error/drift. It is shown that the resulting state of charge error can either be of the time-cumulative or of state-of-charge-proportional type. Time-cumulative errors increase with time and has the potential to completely invalidate the state of charge estimation in the long run. State-of-charge-proportional errors increase with the accumulated state of charge and reach its worst value within one charge/discharge cycle. Simulation analyses are presented to demonstrate the extent of these errors under several realistic scenarios and the paper discusses approaches to reduce the time-cumulative and state of charge-proportional errors.},

With the rapid development of electric vehicles, there is an increasing need to develop and improve the techniques for predicting RUL. To predict RUL, we designed a Transformer-based neural network. First, battery capacity data is always full of noise, especially during battery charge/discharge regeneration. To alleviate this problem, we applied a Denoising Auto-Encoder (DAE) to process raw data. Then, to capture temporal information and learn useful features, a reconstructed sequence was fed into a Transformer network. Finally, to bridge denoising and prediction tasks, we combined these two tasks into a unified framework. Results of extensive experiments conducted on two data sets and a comparison with some existing methods show that our proposed method performs better in predicting RUL. Our projects are all open source and are available at https://github.com/XiuzeZhou/RUL.},

  abstract  = {Vehicle electrification has been proven to be an efficient way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and solve the energy crisis. Lithium-ion batteries (LiBs) are considered the dominant energy storage medium for electric vehicles (EVs) owing to their high energy density and long lifespan. To maintain a safe, efficient, and stable operating condition for the battery system, we must monitor the state of the battery, especially the state-of-charge (SOC) and state-of-health (SOH). With the development of big data, cloud computing, and other emerging techniques, data-driven machine learning (ML) techniques have attracted attention for their enormous potential in state estimation for LiBs. Therefore, this paper reviews the four most studied types of ML algorithms for SOC and SOH estimation, including shallow neural network (NN), deep learning (DL), support vector machine (SVM), and Gaussian process regression (GPR) methods. The basic principles and uniform flowcharts of different ML algorithms are introduced. Then, the applications of each ML algorithm for state estimation within recent years are comprehensively reviewed and compared in terms of used datasets, input features, hyperparameter selection, performance metrics, advantages, and disadvantages. Based on the investigation, this review discusses the current challenges and prospects from four aspects, aiming to provide some inspiration for developing advanced ML state estimation algorithms.},

  abstract   = {One of the most prominent energy storage technologies which are under continuous development, especially for mobile applications, is the Li-ion batteries due to their superior gravimetric and volumetric energy density. However, limited cycle life of Li-ion batteries inhibits their extended use in stationary energy storage applications. To enable wider market penetration of Li-ion batteries, detailed understanding of the degradation mechanisms is required. A typical Li-ion battery comprised of an active material, binder, separator, current collector, and electrolyte, and the interaction between these components plays a critical role in successful operation of such batteries. Degradation of Li-ion batteries can have both chemical and mechanical origins and manifests itself by capacity loss, power fading or both. Mechanical degradation mechanisms are associated with the volume changes and stress generated during repetitive intercalation of Li ions into the active material, whereas chemical degradation mechanisms are associated with the parasitic side reactions such as solid electrolyte interphase formation, electrolyte decomposition/reduction and active material dissolution. In this study, the main degradation mechanisms in Li-ion batteries are reviewed. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

To estimate SOC and SOH quickly and accurately, the battery’s shock response characteristic is analyzed in this paper while fully considering the degree of aging that could impact their operating status. In this paper, a SOC and SOH simultaneous-estimation scheme is proposed based on shock response characteristics. Firstly, the effective and representative features of the voltage impulse response curve are extracted by combining different feature extraction methods. Then, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) is introduced to estimate the SOH and SOC simultaneously. The feature comes from the voltage impulse response curve, which is very convenient to obtain in practical applications. The simulation results show that this method can accurately estimate SOH and SOC for batteries in any SOH state and SOC state, which has strong robustness and generalization ability.},

However, the complex aging mechanism inside the battery makes it difficult to measure the battery SOH directly. In this paper, a SOH estimation method based on a novel dual-stage attention-based recurrent neural network (DARNN) and health feature (HF) extraction from time varying charging process is proposed. Firstly, the constant current charging time, the maximum temperature time, the isochronous voltage difference, and the isochronous current were extracted as lithium-ion battery HFs, and their correlations with SOH are verified by spearman correlation coefficient. Secondly, the DARNN is proposed to capture the time-dependent and temporal features of the input sequence and to accurately predict SOH. Finally, the proposed estimation method is validated on the NASA battery dataset. The results show that the method can accurately estimate SOH for lithium-ion batteries. The mean square error and the mean absolute percentage error of the method are {\textless}0.5 \%.},

The safety and performance of these applications rely on accurate Battery Management Systems (BMS) to monitor and optimize battery performance. Traditional BMS systems face challenges in charge prediction processes due to complex chemical processes and battery aging, leading to faults. The absence of a perfect sensor highlights limitations in measurement issues arising from external factors, especially sensor noise. Therefore, there is a need for algorithms that can solve the real-world battery charge prediction problem. This study compares an innovative solution, the Transformer model, with traditional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bi-directional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) models, and Support Vector Regression (SVR). This research aims to provide new perspectives on Battery State of Charge (SoC) predictions using NASA, BMW i3, Stanford University Battery Datasets, and real-world battery data obtained from L5 EV of the Musoshi brand collected for this work. This research’s primary objective is to apply the Transformer model to real-world battery data, evaluating it as a significant step in EV range optimization and battery management.

  abstract  = {This dataset encompasses cycling experiments conducted on lithium-ion batteries, involving 5 distinct batches, each originating from a different manufacturer. Within each batch, there were 6 batteries subjected to testing. The battery types employed for testing included cylindrical 21700 cells and 18650 type and nickel manganese cobalt or nickel cobalt aluminum.The testing procedure consisted of an initial Constant Current (CC) charging step, taking the batteries to 4.2 V at a rate of 0.5 C, followed by a Constant Voltage (CV) step that maintained the voltage at 4.2 V until the current dropped to 0.02 C. Subsequently, the cells underwent discharge at a rate of 1 C until the voltage reached 2.5 V.For the light cycling profile, a similar CC-CV charging protocol was applied, with an initial CC charge to 4.1 V at 0.5 C, followed by CV charging at 4.1 V until the current decayed to 0.02 C. A constant current discharge at 1 C was then executed, with a lower voltage cutoff set at 3.0 V. In all instances, there was a resting period of 10 minutes between the charge and discharge stages. The C-rate for each cell was calculated based on the nominal capacity specified by the manufacturer.},

  abstract = {The capacity fade of Sony 18650S Li-ion cells has been analyzed using cyclic voltammetry, impedance spectroscopy and electron probe microscopic analysis (EPMA). The surface resistance at both the positive (LiCoO2) and negative (carbon) electrodes were found to increase with cycling. This increase in resistance contributes to decreased capacity. Impedance data reveal that the interfacial resistance at LiCoO2 electrode is larger than that at the carbon electrode. The impedance of the positive electrode (LiCoO2) dominates the total cell resistance initially and also after 800 charge–discharge cycles. EPMA analysis on carbon electrodes taken from the fresh and cycled cell show the presence of oxidation products in the case of cycled cells. No change in the electrolyte resistance is seen with cycling.},

  abstract = {Lithium-ion batteries are regarded as the key energy storage technology for both e-mobility and stationary renewable energy storage applications. Nevertheless, Lithium-ion batteries are complex energy storage devices, which are characterized by a complex degradation behavior, which affects both their capacity and internal resistance. This paper investigates, based on extended laboratory calendar ageing tests, the degradation of the internal resistance of a lithium-ion battery. The dependence of the internal resistance increase on the temperature and state-of-charge level has been extensive studied and quantified. Based on the obtained laboratory results, an accurate semiempirical lifetime model, which is able to predict with high accuracy the internal resistance increase of the lithium-ion battery over a wide temperature range and for all state-of-charge levels, was proposed and validated.},

  abstract   = {Time series analysis is of immense importance in extensive applications, such as weather forecasting, anomaly detection, and action recognition. This paper focuses on temporal variation modeling, which is the common key problem of extensive analysis tasks. Previous methods attempt to accomplish this directly from the 1D time series, which is extremely challenging due to the intricate temporal patterns. Based on the observation of multi-periodicity in time series, we ravel out the complex temporal variations into the multiple intraperiod- and interperiod-variations. To tackle the limitations of 1D time series in representation capability, we extend the analysis of temporal variations into the 2D space by transforming the 1D time series into a set of 2D tensors based on multiple periods. This transformation can embed the intraperiod- and interperiod-variations into the columns and rows of the 2D tensors respectively, making the 2D-variations to be easily modeled by 2D kernels. Technically, we propose the TimesNet with TimesBlock as a task-general backbone for time series analysis. TimesBlock can discover the multi-periodicity adaptively and extract the complex temporal variations from transformed 2D tensors by a parameter-efficient inception block. Our proposed TimesNet achieves consistent state-of-the-art in five mainstream time series analysis tasks, including short- and long-term forecasting, imputation, classification, and anomaly detection.

  abstract = {State/temperature monitoring is one of the key requirements of battery management systems that facilitates efficient and intelligent management to ensure the safe operation of batteries in electrified transportation. This paper proposes an online end-to-end state monitoring method based on transferred multi-task learning. Measurement data is directly used for sharing information generation with the convolutional neural network. Then, the multiple task-specific layers are added for state/temperature monitoring. The transfer learning strategy is designed to improve accuracy further under various application scenarios. Experiments under different working profiles, temperatures, and aging conditions are conducted to evaluate the method, which covers the wide usage ranges in electric vehicles. Comparisons with several benchmarks illustrate the superiority of the proposed method with better accuracy and computational efficiency. The monitoring results under extremely current working profiles and variable internal and external conditions are evaluated. Results show that the mean absolute error and root mean square error of state of charge and state of energy estimation are less than 2.31\% and 3.31\%, respectively. The above errors in the prediction of future temperature five steps ahead are less than 0.89 °C and 1.29 °C, respectively. The framework is also suitable for monitoring second-life batteries retired from electric vehicles. This paper illustrates the potential application of data-driven multi-state monitoring throughout the entire battery life.},
