\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I would like to express my deepest gratitude to those who have supported me throughout this journey. To my girlfriend, mother, father, brother, and family, thank you for your unwavering support, encouragement, and love over the years. Your presence has been a constant source of strength and inspiration.

I am profoundly grateful to my supervisors, Professor Luís Conde Bento and Professor Mónica Figueiredo, for their invaluable guidance and expertise. They introduced me to an entirely new field of study, broadening my knowledge and teaching me innovative methods of work that have shaped my academic and professional growth.

Finally, I extend my heartfelt thanks to my friends who have been by my side since the beginning of this course. Their companionship, encouragement, and shared experiences have been instrumental in keeping me motivated and focused throughout this work.
