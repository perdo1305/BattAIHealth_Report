\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to express my gratitude to everyone who supported me throughout this journey. To my girlfriend, mother, father, brother, and family. Thank you for always believing in me and encouraging me at every step.

I am deeply grateful to my supervisors, Professor Luís Conde Bento and Professor Mónica Figueiredo, for their guidance, patience, and for introducing me to a completely new field of study. Their valuable insights and mentorship, as well as the resources provided through the Advanced Robotics and Smart Factories Lab, including a dedicated workspace and computer for training the networks described in this work, were essential for my development and for the completion of this project.

Finally, I want to thank my friends who have been by my side since the beginning of this course, sharing both challenges and achievements.

Many thanks to all!
