I want to thank everyone who helped me during this work. To my girlfriend, mother, father, brother, and family, thank you for always supporting me and believing in me.

I am very grateful to my supervisors, Professor Luís Conde Bento and Professor Mónica Figueiredo, for their help and teaching. They showed me a completely new area of study and taught me new ways of working that helped me grow in knowledge and skills

I also want to thank my friends who have been with me since the start of this course.

Thank you all!
